3rd from the end
Write an algorithm to find the 3rd element from the end of a linked list. Note You may be tempted to add a length property to your linked list class. The length property is not a typical property of linked list, therefore don't make any modification to the linked list class that is provided to you.

Cycle in a list
Write an algorithm to find whether a linked list has a cycle (i.e., whether a node in the list has its next value pointing to an earlier node in the list). For this exercise, create a linked list with the name CycleList. Be sure to insert nodes in the list so that it has a cycle. Then test your program with a cycleList function.
